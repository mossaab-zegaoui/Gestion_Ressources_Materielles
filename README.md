# Gestion_Ressources_Materielles
**Project Overview**

This software aims to efficiently manage the material resources of different departments within the faculty.
It facilitates communication and coordination among departments, resource managers, maintenance services, and suppliers. 
The software ensures secure access to its services for all users involved.

**Tender Management**

The primary functionality of the software is to streamline the tender process for resource acquisition. Here's an overview of the workflow:

1-  Department Needs:

The head of a department initiates the process by requesting the teachers in the department to submit their resource requirements. These needs include materials necessary for teaching and equipment for department-wide use.

2-  Department Consultation: 

After a consultation meeting within the department, modifications can be made to the resource needs based on collective input. The department head then consolidates the revised needs and forwards them to the responsible person in charge of issuing a call for tenders.

3-  Tender Creation:

The responsible person, often referred to as the manager, gathers the resource needs from all departments to create a comprehensive tender. The tender includes a starting date and an end date for supplier submissions.

4-  Supplier Participation:

Suppliers, representing companies, can register on the software platform and view the active tenders. They can then submit their proposals, specifying brands and prices for each material. Supplier registration requires creating an account with the company name.

5-  Supplier Evaluation:

Upon the completion of the tender submission period, the manager evaluates the received proposals. Suppliers who have consistently failed to meet their commitments in the past may be eliminated from consideration (added to a black list). The manager notifies the eliminated suppliers of the reasons for their exclusion.

6-  Acceptance and Rejection: 

The manager selects the offer from the lowest bidder and notifies them of the acceptance. Simultaneously, a rejection notification is sent to the remaining suppliers who did not win the bid. The accepted supplier is then awaited for delivery.

**Security**

*  The software places utmost importance on ensuring the security of its services. The following security measures are implemented:

*  User Authentication: All users, including department heads, teachers, resource managers, maintenance personnel, and suppliers, are required to authenticate themselves before accessing the software's features.

*  Secure Communication: The software employs secure communication protocols to safeguard data transmission between users and the software's servers. This ensures that sensitive information remains confidential during transit.

*  Access Control: Different user roles are defined within the system, allowing access privileges to be granted based on individual responsibilities and requirements. This prevents unauthorized access to confidential data and limits functionality based on user roles.
